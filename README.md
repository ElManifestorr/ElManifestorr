- 👋 Hi, I’m @ElManifestorr
- 👀 I’m interested in finding new ways and ideas to create & enjoying the process. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web development(JavaScript, CSS, HTML), smart contracts(Solidity), and automating anything I can on the way(Python). I guess I'm always learning more UNIX/Bash as well. I love me a good script. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything where I'm learning/applying concepts I could use again!
- 📫 How to reach me: E-Mail @ elmanifestorr@protonmail.com Put the subject as something cool like "The next 1000x!" or something that will catch my eye lmao
